I am a trainee software developer with a strong foundation in Java 11 and 17, as well as knowledge in object-oriented programming and SQL. Currently, I am studying Flutter to be able to compete in the field of iOS and Android development. My previous job allowed me to assist in the development of a ticket sales and seat location system, where I discovered my passion for programming. Nowadays, I am striving to find a place to progress and build my experience in this field.
