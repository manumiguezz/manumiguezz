Currently coding with Java/C at GAO Tek Inc. With a solid foundation of knowledge and experience in programming, I specialize in Java 11 and Java 17, as well as database structures (MySQL/SQLite3). 

In addition to my programming experience, I am expanding my skills in mobile and web development through studying Flutter and Dart. My goal is to apply my knowledge in these technologies to create efficient and appealing solutions for both mobile applications and web platforms.
